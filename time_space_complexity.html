<!-- Time complexity:  The time complexity is generally calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the execution -->
<!-- Space complexity: space complexity is the amount of space required to finish the execution
  space complexity= auxillary space+ input size
 -->
<!-- Big O notation: Use to denote both complexity -->


Time complexity is often preferred because:
1.Performance Impact: Faster algorithms improve user experience and responsiveness, which is crucial for applications, especially in real-time systems.

2.Memory Availability: With abundant and inexpensive memory, optimizing for speed can be more beneficial unless memory usage becomes a limiting factor.

3.Scalability: As data grows, the time required to process it becomes a significant concern, often more than the space it occupies.

4.Cost of Time vs. Space: The impact of reduced execution time is generally more noticeable than reduced memory usage, especially on modern hardware.


How to find the Time Complexity or running time for performing the operations?
Suppose we have an array of five elements, and we want to add a new element at the beginning of the array. To achieve this, we need to shift each element towards right, and suppose each element takes one unit of time. There are five elements, so five units of time would be taken. Suppose there are 1000 elements in an array, then it takes 1000 units of time to shift. It concludes that time complexity depends upon the input size.
Therefore, if the input size is n, then f(n) is a function of n that denotes the time complexity.
